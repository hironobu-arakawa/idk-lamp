# Notes / Scratchpad

This file is a place to roughly place:
- Ideas
- Unorganized discomforts
- Things I want to do in the future

To not break the structure, do not rush to conclusions here.

Examples:
- What happens if it is dropped into UI
- What changes in business use
- How to write the relationship with BOA



## 2025-01-12: Notes on the day the structure began to take shape

- The skeleton of the Decision Closure Structure rose up at once today
- The conversion of 5 Axes -> Danger Condition -> Closure Step converged naturally
- The 5 classifications of Transition became clearly visible
- The positioning of idk-lamp was fixed not as a "limit of ability" but as a "signal of structure"
- Decided to place BOA on the outside (to protect the purity of the hierarchy)

* This is not a completion, but recorded as the "current location" of structuring as of today
