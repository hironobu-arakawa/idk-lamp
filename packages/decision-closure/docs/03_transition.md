# Transition (Mid-way Inversion)

Transition is a phenomenon where the nature of the decision changes during the dialogue.

- A decision that was AI-Closed
- Transitions to Human-Closed

This is not accidental, but a **phenomenon that can be explained structurally**.

## When Transition Occurs

Transition occurs when changes such as the following happen:

- The responsible entity was expanded
- A decision that was cancellable became irreversible
- Action or time started to chain into the future
- Social context emerged

All of these are the result of one of the steps of Decision Closure collapsing.

## Principles during Transition

- Retain the thinking material up to that point
- Do not conclude or aggregate
- Do not close the decision, return it to the human

Transition is treated not as a signal to "stop because it's dangerous", but as a **signal indicating that the nature of the decision has changed**.
