# World Assumption: Undefined-Use World

This structure assumes an **Undefined-Use World**.

An Undefined-Use World refers to a state where:
- The user themselves has not clearly defined the use
- Reference, decision, and action fluctuate during the dialogue
- Disclaimer and responsibility cannot be determined within AI

In conversational AI and personal AI, this state is the norm.

In this assumption, AI cannot observe values of the "5 axes of decision" such as:
- Who the counterpart is
- Who assumes responsibility
- How accurate it needs to be
- What the situation and time axis are

Therefore, in this structure, we give up using the values of the 5 axes from the beginning and adopt a design that **handles only the moment it tipped to the dangerous side**.
