# Correspondence between 5 Axes of Decision and Closure Structure

Human judgment involves the following 5 axes:

- Counterpart
- Responsibility
- Accuracy
- Situation
- Time

In an undefined-use world, these values cannot be directly observed.

Therefore, in this structure, the 5 axes are abstracted as follows:

| Decision Axis | Danger Condition | Corresponding Closure Collapse |
|---|---|---|
| Counterpart | Social context exists | Step 5 |
| Responsibility | Multiple responsible entities | Step 1 |
| Accuracy | Mistake is irreversible | Step 3 |
| Situation | Psychological cancellation / Chain | Step 2 / 4 |
| Time | Chain to future direction | Step 4 |

The 5 axes are not discarded.
The closure structure is a "purified form" of the 5 axes.
